# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Asset Organization
The repository currently stores finished artwork files at the project root; each `.JPG` or `.webp` file is a curated retro image ready for publication. Keep additions in the root unless a new collection truly merits a subfolder, and mirror the existing UUID-style names (`33ffcb7c-f838-465d-a185-6d0af34433f7.JPG`) for generative batches while using short kebab-case descriptors (`wooden-stand.webp`) for hand-edited hero shots. Always ship two versions of any newly color-corrected asset: an untouched original saved offline and an optimized upload (≤4 MB, sRGB, stripped metadata) committed here.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no bundled build pipeline, but run these repeatable checks before opening a pull request:
- `magick identify <file>` verifies dimensions, color-space, and compression level.
- `magick compare -metric PSNR reference.jpg candidate.jpg diff.png` validates refreshes against prior baselines.
- `sips --getProperty format <file>` (macOS) double-checks that uploads remain in their intended format.

## Asset Styling & Naming Conventions
Preserve the 300 DPI baseline and export in sRGB unless art direction requires an alternate profile. Resize with `magick convert <file> -resize 2048x2048 -quality 90 <output>` to match shop-ready resolution, and keep monochrome variants in RGB so downstream tooling renders consistently. Filenames should stay lowercase except for legacy UUID assets; replace spaces with hyphens, limit descriptors to three words, and use the `retro-{scene}-{variant}.webp` pattern for new stylized sets.

## Testing & QA Guidelines
Before committing, open each asset in a calibrated viewer to ensure hue accuracy and no banding. Run `magick identify -format "%f %wx%h %r\n" *.JPG` to spot resolution outliers quickly. If adding scripted transforms, include the command snippet in the pull request description and attach a diff image generated by `magick compare` when updating an existing asset so reviewers can gauge visual impact.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use imperative Conventional Commit subjects scoped to imagery, for example `assets: add neon bowling alley marquee` or `fix: rebalance contrast on wooden stand`. Group related assets in a single commit and note source prompts, Lightroom presets, or manual adjustments in the body for future reference. Each pull request should summarize the collection theme, list affected filenames, include before/after thumbnails when revising art, and link to any licensing confirmations or client briefs that guided the work.
